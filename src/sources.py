    """Source term

    Note, the mesh arrangement must be Y first and then X. For example, U[0, j, i]
    is the w of j-th cell in y-direction and i-th cell in x-direction.

    Args:
    -----
        U: a 3D torch.tensor of shape (3, Ny+2*Ngh, Nx+2Ngh) representing
            w, hu, and hv.
        dBc: a dictionary of the following key-value pair
            x: a 2d torch.tensor of shape (Ny, Nx) representing the topographic
                x-gradient at cell centers, i.e., $\partial B / \partial x$.
            y: a 2d torch.tensor of shape (Ny, Nx) representing the topographic
                y-gradient at cell centers, i.e., $\partial B / \partial y$.
        Bc: a 2D torch.tensor of shape (Ny, Nx) representing elevations at cell
            centers, excluding ghost cells. Bc must be from the bilinear
            interpolation of elevation of cell coreners.
        Ngh: an integer, the number of ghost cells outside each boundary
        g: gravity

    Returns:
    --------
        S: a 3D torch.tensor of shape (3, Ny, Nx) representing the source terms
            for continuity equation and momentum equations for each cell.
