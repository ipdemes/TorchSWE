    """Discontinuous solution at interfaces with piecewise linear approximation.

    Note, the returned interface values have not been fixed for postivity

    Args:
    -----
        U: a 3D torch.tensor of shape (3, Ny+2*Ngh, Nx+2*Ngh) representing w,
            hu, and hv at cell centers; the extra cells are ghost cells.
        dU: a dictionary of the following key-value pairs
            x: a (3, Ny, Nx+2) torch.tensor for $\partial U / \partial x$
                at cell centers. Only one layer of ghost cells is included at
                each domain boundary in x direction.
            y: a (3, Ny+2, Nx) torch.tensor for $\partial U / \partial y$
                at cell centers. Only one layer of ghost cells is included at
                each domain boundary in y direction.
        dx: a scalar of cell szie, assuming dx = dy and is uniform everywhere.
        Ngh: an integer, number of ghost cells outside each boundary

    Returns:
    --------
        Uf: a dictionary of the following key-value pairs
            xm: a (3, Ny, Nx+1) torch.tensor representing the U values at the
                left sides of the cell interfaces normal to x-direction.
            xp: a (3, Ny, Nx+1) torch.tensor representing the U values at the
                right sides of the cell interfaces normal to x-direction.
            ym: a (3, Ny+1, Nx) torch.tensor representing the U values at the
                bottom sides of the cell interfaces normal to y-direction.
            yp: a (3, Ny+1, Nx) torch.tensor representing the U values at the
                top sides of the cell interfaces normal to y-direction.
