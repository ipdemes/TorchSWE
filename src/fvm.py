    Args:
    -----
        U: a 3D torch.tensor of shape (3, Ny+2*Ngh, Nx+2Ngh) representing
            w, hu, and hv.
        Bf: a dictionary of the following key-value pairs
            x: a (Ny, Nx+1) torch.tensor representing the elevations at
                interfaces midpoint for those normal to x-direction. Must be
                calculated from the linear interpolation from corner elevations.
            y: a (Ny+1, Nx) torch.tensor representing the elevations at
                interfaces midpoint for those normal to y-direction. Must be
                calculated from the linear interpolation from corner elevations.
        Bc: a 2D torch.tensor of shape (Ny, Nx) representing elevations at cell
            centers, excluding ghost cells. Bc must be from the bilinear
            interpolation of elevation of cell coreners.
        dBc: a dictionary of the following key-value pair
            x: a 2d torch.tensor of shape (Ny, Nx) representing the topographic
                x-gradient at cell centers, i.e., $\partial B / \partial x$.
            y: a 2d torch.tensor of shape (Ny, Nx) representing the topographic
                y-gradient at cell centers, i.e., $\partial B / \partial y$.
        dx: a scalar of cell szie, assuming dx = dy and is uniform everywhere.
        Ngh: an integer, the number of ghost cells outside each boundary
        g: gravity
        epsilon: a very small number to avoid division by zero.

    Returns:
    --------
        f: a (3, Ny, Nx) torch.tensor to update the conservative variables in
            interior cell centers.
        max_dt: a scalar indicating the maximum safe time-step size.
