    Should not be used explicitly. It is supposed to be called by other schemes.

    -----
        Ufm: either a (3, Ny, Nx+1) or (3, Ny+1, Nx) torch.tensor, depending on
            whether it's in x or y direction; the discontinuous conservative
            quantities at the left or the bottom of cell interfaces.
        Ufp: either a (3, Ny, Nx+1) or (3, Ny+1, Nx) torch.tensor, depending on
            whether it's in x or y direction; the discontinuous conservative
            quantities at the right or the top of cell interfaces.
        Fm: ither a (3, Ny, Nx+1) or (3, Ny+1, Nx) torch.tensor, depending on
            whether it's in x or y direction; the flux at the left or the bottom
            of cell interfaces.
        Fp: ither a (3, Ny, Nx+1) or (3, Ny+1, Nx) torch.tensor, depending on
            whether it's in x or y direction; the flux at the right or the top
            of cell interfaces.
        am: ither a (Ny, Nx+1) or (Ny+1, Nx) torch.tensor, depending on whether
            it's in x or y direction; the local speed at the left or the bottom
            of cell interfaces.
        ap: ither a (Ny, Nx+1) or (Ny+1, Nx) torch.tensor, depending on whether
            it's in x or y direction; the local speed at the right or the top of
            cell interfaces.

            whether it's in x or y direction; the numerical (common) flux at the
            cell interfaces.
