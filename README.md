TorchSWE: GPU shallow-water equation solver using PyTorch
=========================================================

A simple SWE solver on GPU through PyTorch. I have a very specific application
in mind for this solver, so it's capability is somehow limited. And I intend to
keep it simple, instead of generalizing it to general-purpose SWE solver.
However, because it's implemented in Python, I believe it's not difficult to
apply modifications for other applications.
