    Arguments
    ---------
    states : torchswe.utils.data.States
        Data model instance holding conservative quantities at cell centers with ghost cells.
    runtime : torchswe.utils.misc.DummyDict
        A DummyDict that we can access a Topography instance through `runtime.topo`.
    config : torchswe.utils.config.Config
        A `Config` instance. We use the gravity paramater (in m/s^2) through config.params.gravity.

    Returns
    -------
    states : torchswe.utils.data.States
        The same object as the input. Changes are done in-place. Returning it just for coding style.

    Arguments
    ---------
    states : torchswe.utils.data.States
        Data model instance holding conservative quantities at cell centers with ghost cells.
    runtime : torchswe.utils.misc.DummyDict
        A DummyDict. We need to access `runtime.ptsource`, `runtime.cur_t` and
        `runtime.dt_constraint`. `runtime.ptsource` is an instance of
        `torchswe.utils.data.PointSource`, and `runtime.cur_t` is a float indicating the current
        simulation time. `runtime.dt_constraint` is a float of current time-step size constraint
        due to non-stability-related issues.
    *args, **kwargs :
        To absorb unused provided arguments to make all source term calculations using the same
        signature.

    -------
    states : torchswe.utils.data.States
        The same object as the input. Changes are done in-place. Returning it just for coding style.

    Notes
    -----
    runtime.dt will be changed to a value so that runtime.cur_t + runtime.dt won't exceed the
    switch time point for the next point source profile.
