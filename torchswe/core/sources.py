    Arguments
    ---------
    states : torchswe.utils.data.States
        Data model instance holding conservative quantities at cell centers with ghost cells.
    topo : torchswe.utils.data.Topography
        Topography data model instance.
    gravity : float
        Gravity in m/s^2.

    Returns
    -------
    states : torchswe.utils.data.States
        The same object as the input. Changes are done in-place. Returning it just for coding style.

    Notes
    -----
    This function does not add data to existing arrays. Instead, it re-initialize w with zeros, and
    re-assign the hu and hv with newly calculated topographic gradients.
