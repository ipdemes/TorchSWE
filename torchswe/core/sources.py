    Arguments
    ---------
    states : torchswe.utils.data.States
        Data model instance holding conservative quantities at cell centers with ghost cells.
    topo : torchswe.utils.data.Topography
        Topography data model instance.
    gravity : float
        Gravity in m/s^2.

    Returns
    -------
    states : torchswe.utils.data.States
        The same object as the input. Changes are done in-place. Returning it just for coding style.
