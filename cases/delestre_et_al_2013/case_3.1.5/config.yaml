# Delestre et al. (2013): case 3.1.5; transcritical flow with shock

# domain information
domain:
    west: 0.0             # a float; x-coordinate of the left boundary
    east: 25.0            # a float; x-coordinate of the right boundary
    south: 0.0            # a float; y-coordinate of the top boundary
    north: 5.0           # a float; y-coordinate of the bottom boundary

# information regarding spatial discretization
discretization:
    Nx: 200               # in integer; number of cells in west-east direction
    Ny: 40               # in integer; number of cells in north-south direction

# boundary conditions
# options for type: periodic, extrap, const
# the key "values" is only used by "const" type BC
boundary conditions:
    west:
        types: [extrap, const, extrap]
        values: [null, 0.18, null]
    east:
