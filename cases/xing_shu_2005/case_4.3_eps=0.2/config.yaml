# Xing and Shu, 2005: case 4.3 & eps=0.2

# domain information
domain:
    west: 0.0             # a float; x-coordinate of the left boundary
    east: 2.0            # a float; x-coordinate of the right boundary
    south: 0.0            # a float; y-coordinate of the top boundary
    north: 1.0           # a float; y-coordinate of the bottom boundary

# information regarding spatial discretization
discretization:
    Nx: 200               # in integer; number of cells in west-east direction
    Ny: 100               # in integer; number of cells in north-south direction

# boundary conditions
# options for type: periodic, extrap, const
# the key "values" is only used by "const" type BC
boundary conditions:
    west:
        types: [extrap, extrap, extrap]
